## The Selection Process

1. **Initial Application & CV Submission**  
   I submitted my CV, and after careful evaluation, I was shortlisted for the online interview.

2. **Online Interview & Shortlisting**  
   The interview assessed technical knowledge, communication, and analytical skills. Successful candidates were invited to join the program.

3. **Final Evaluation**  
   Candidates were monitored continuously throughout the sessions, including **skill assessments, interactions, and teamwork exercises**.  
   The **selection for the final 21 participants was based primarily on individual performance**, with approximately **70% of the marks coming from individual assessments** such as exams, interviews, and personal contributions.

## Stage 1: Team-Based Project Challenge

We were assigned to teams and challenged to come up with a **tech-based startup idea** in just **2 days**. My team, **Deshpreneur**, designed a **device using ML and LED lights for early breast cancer detection**, aiming to make screening **non-invasive, affordable, and accessible**â€”unlike conventional mammography, which is invasive and limited to once-a-year usage.  

We brainstormed, created slides, planned the model, and presented our idea to judges. This stage evaluated **teamwork, leadership, and presentation skills**, and we were **selected as the best team**!

Unfortunately, I did not make it to the regional round, but the experience was **incredibly valuable**, providing insights into project management, innovation, and collaboration at a high level.
