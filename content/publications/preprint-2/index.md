abstract: I present a real-time currency detection system designed to assist visually impaired individuals, utilizing a YOLOv8 nano model with a custom detection head featuring deep convolutional layers and Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks. Trained on a dataset of 30 classes across USD, EUR, and BDT currencies, my model achieves 97.73% accuracy, 95.23% recall, 95.85% F1-score, and 97.21% mAP50(B), demonstrating its effectiveness. Integrated voice feedback enhances usability, reflecting my focus on applying machine learning to create accessible, practical solutions. This work was submitted to arXiv on October 23, 2025.
